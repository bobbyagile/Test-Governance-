As far as possible, all test stages will follow a pragmatic risk-based approach.
In practical terms. this means that test preparation and execution will focus on the highest risk areas first.
When determining higest risk areas, the following will b considered as a guidline:

-> Criticality to the business 
-> Technical Complexity 
-> Contactual and Legal Requirements 
-> Likelihood of failure 

All requirements, test scenarios and test scripts will be prioritised based on these risk areas using infomration collected and documented during reviews and discussions held with 
the project stakeholder teams during the test design activity.

Below is a diagram that can be used to determine the risk and apply a risk rating to acceptance criteria.  "https://www.qamadness.com/your-guide-to-understanding-risk-based-testing/"
